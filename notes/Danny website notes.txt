Oil-based and Water-based House Paint
As the name suggests, oil-based paints are made with oil, and water-based with water. Generally, oil-based paints are more durable, shiny, and take longer to dry, and water-based paints are thinner, matte, and take less time to dry.

Enamel Paint
Enamel paints can be found in a variety of finishes, including gloss and semi-gloss, and are often used on trims around windows and doors. One drawback of enamel paint is that is tends to discolour over time.
